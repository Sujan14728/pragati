    description: `The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to register a petition against the ordinance to amend the National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act-2017 forwarded by the government to the President’s Office for authentication.

        The petition that was presented before the apex court by advocates Kapildev Dhakal and Rajendra Prasad Dangal and former secretary Dwarikanath Dhungel was rejected by the court’s registrar Narayan Prasad Panthi.
        
        The petition had named Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, the President’s Office, the Office of Prime Minister and Council of Minister, the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, the Home Ministry and the Office of Attorney General as defendants.
        
        The petitioners had demanded the court order the President’s Office not to authenticate the ordinance.
        
        “The writ can’t be filed as it is presented before the court in an immature state as bills passed by the parliament and ordinances forwarded by the government become laws only after authentication by the President,” registrar Panthi mentioned as the cause for the rejection.
        
        The government forwarded the disputed ordinance to the President’s Office on Monday.`,

    headline: "Ruling alliance two seats shy of majority",
    description: `The CPN-UML, which trailed the ruling Nepali Congress in the first-past-the-post (FPTP) seats, has won the most (34) seats of the lower house under the proportional representation (PR) system.

    In the seat allocation completed on Tuesday night, the ruling Congress has managed to bag 32 PR seats. The party that had won 57 FPTP seats will now have a total strength of 89 seats in the House of Representatives, to become the largest party.
    
    The UML, with 78 seats (including 44 from the FPTP) will have a presence in parliament as the second largest party.
    
    Some 61 percent of the 17.98 million registered voters cast their ballots in the single-phase parliamentary and provincial elections on November 20. As per the commission’s report, the number of valid PR votes was 10.05 million.
    
    Of this total, the UML collected 2.84 million PR votes. The Congress was hot on its heels with 2.71 million PR votes, followed by the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party, which collected 1.17 million and 1.13 million votes, respectively.
    
    The Maoist Centre, which won 18 seats under the FPTP system, has managed to secure 14 more seats under the PR system, to have a total of 32 representatives in the lower house. With 13 seats under the PR, the Rastriya Swatantra Party takes hold of the fourth position with a total of 20 seats including seven FPTP seats.
    
    Out of the 68 parties registered for the election under the PR system only seven could meet the threshold of three percent votes needed to qualify for parliament seats under the PR category. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Janamat Party are other three parties which have met the threshold.
    
    Despite winning 10 seats under the FPTP system, the CPN (Unified Socialist) couldn’t cross the threshold.
    
    Based on the vote share, the commission had allocated the 110 PR seats of parliament among the eligible parties. “We have apportioned the seats based on the vote share of the seven parties crossing the threshold,” Dinesh Thapaliya, the chief election commissioner, told the Post.

    As per the seat allocation, the pro-Hindu and pro-monarchy Rastriya Prajatantra Party party won seven seats under the PR category, to equal its seat tally under the FPTP category. The Janata Samajbadi Party that had registered victory in seven seats under the direct elections has got five seats under the PR system.
    
    The CK Raut-led Janamat Party that crossed the threshold to become a national party in its first foray into parliamentary elections also has got five seats, bringing it on level terms with the Janata Samajbadi Party. (Janamat Party had won one FPTP seat.)
    
    In this way, the five-party ruling alliance has secured 136 seats against 138 required to prove a majority in the 275-strong House. The alliance includes the Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, and the Rastriya Janamorcha, which have won 89, 32, 10, four and one seats, respectively.
    
    “The commission on Wednesday will ask the parties to name lawmakers under the PR category,” Surya Aryal, assistant spokesperson at the commission, told the Post. “The parties will have to send the names from the closed lists they had earlier submitted to the commission.”
    
    The seven parties will get three days to send the names to the commission. If their list doesn’t have proper representation of various clusters of caste groups and communities, they will get one more day to make corrections. “We will submit the final report to the President when the names under the proportional representation are finalised,” said Aryal, adding the report is likely to be presented on December 12 or the next day.
    
    Submission of the final report will clear the way for the parties to form government and commence the new parliament. After receiving election results from the commission, President Bidya Devi Bhandari will invite parties to form a government within two days. As no party commands a majority, she will call for a coalition government as per Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal.
    
    Similarly, the process to summon the first meeting of the House of Representation will begin following the submission of the election results to the President. As per Article 93 (1) of the constitution, the President summons a new session of the federal parliament within 30 days of the declaration of final results.
    
    If the final results are submitted on December 12, the first meeting of parliament must start latest by January 11. “Our preparations for the first meeting of the lower house are in full swing. We have already arranged office spaces for the new parties that were not represented in the previous Parliament,” Roj Nath Pandey, spokesperson at the parliament secretariat, told the Post.
    
    The selection process for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives will also start with its first meeting as per Article 91 (1) of the constitution. “The members of the House of Representatives shall, within 15 days of the date of holding of the first meeting of the House of Representatives, elect a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker from amongst themselves,” reads the Article.

    headline: "Nepal-Bangladesh joint venture project gets environmental nod",
    description: `The Ministry of Forest and Environment has cleared the Environment Impact Assessment Report for the proposed 160-billion-rupee, 683-megawatt Sunkoshi 3 hydropower project, paving the way for bilateral negotiations between Nepal and Bangladesh to develop the project.

    The two countries have agreed to develop the project through a joint venture investment as per the agreement reached between the two sides during the fourth meeting of the working group and joint steering committee held in late August.
    
    As per the press statement issued by the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation on August 25, the two sides agreed that Nepal would send the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report to Bangladesh, as early as possible, on which the Bangladeshi side would give its opinion at the earliest, while taking ahead the process of establishing a joint venture company.
    
    Officials at the energy ministry confirmed that the EIA report has got approval from the Ministry of Forest and Environment.
    
    “We have received the letter from the environment ministry about the approval given to the EIA report on the development of Sunkoshi 3,” said Chiranjeewee Chataut, director general at the Department of Electricity Development. The EIA was under the environment ministry’s consideration since April this year.
    
    
    Officials said the government would share the report with Bangladesh as agreed in August.

“Once we share the report with the Bangladeshi side, they will review it, seek needed clarifications and a joint technical team is then expected to visit the project site,” said Madhu Bhetuwal, spokesperson at the energy ministry. “After that, the two sides are expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on project development, paving the way for joining project development.”

Though the two sides have agreed to develop the project through a joint venture company, it is unclear which agencies would be involved in the project which will be built at the border between Ramechhap and Kavrepalanchowk districts.

Officials said Nepal’s obvious choice for the joint venture is the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the state-owned power utility.

The NEA has also been eager to be a partner in the project. “There has been an initial talk about handing out the construction licence to Nepal Electricity Authority, but no official decision has been made,” said the NEA Managing Director Kul Man Ghising. “If we get the licence, we can hand it over to the new joint venture company, provided a joint venture agreement is reached between the NEA and a Bangladeshi entity.”

Power-hungry Bangladesh has been eager to develop hydropower projects in Nepal and buy electricity from the country.

In the August meeting, Nepal and Bangladesh had decided to request India to provide passage for the export of 40-50 MW of electricity from Nepal to Bangladesh in the initial phase, utilising the high voltage direct current power systems located in Bheramara of Bangladesh.

For this, they agreed to ask for a trilateral energy sales and purchase agreement among the NEA, Bangladesh Power Development Board, and India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) on utilising the Baharampur-Bheramara cross-border power transmission link.

In 2013, India and Bangladesh inaugurated the Baharampur-Bheramara cross-border power transmission link between the countries that would initially facilitate the export of 500 MW of electricity.

In fact, the NEA said it had sent a request to NVVN in late August as per the agreement reached between Nepal and Bangladesh. “We are yet to get a response from the Indian company,” said Ghising.

As per the Joint Vision Statement on Power Sector Cooperation issued in early April during the state visit of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to India, the two countries aim to expand cooperation in the power sector and include partner countries under Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (BBIN) framework. “India’s cooperation will be crucial to realise the dream of power trade between Nepal and Bangladesh,” said Bhetuwal.

    headline: "Dahal wants to be prime minister. Does he stand a chance?",
    description: `With the counting of both the first-past-the-post (FPTP) and proportional representation (PR) votes of the November 20 elections nearly over, leaders have intensified meetings and behind-the-curtain negotiations to form a new government and, above all, to decide the new prime minister.

    There are several claimants for the post. Incumbent Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, and Congress leader Ram Chandra Paudel, among others, have already staked their claims to the top executive job.
    
    And with no party getting a majority, there is no clarity on the shape of the new government as well as on its leadership.
    
    A section of the Congress establishment camp has already proposed Deuba for prime minister. “We should not seek an alternative to Deuba,” Congress Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka said on Thursday.
    
    “We went to the election under his leadership and got respectable results. So no one should doubt that Deuba is the undisputed candidate for parliamentary party leader,” he added. As per the charter of the Nepali Congress, any lawmaker aspiring to become prime minister should first be elected parliamentary party leader.
    
    Khadka, a lieutenant of Deuba, met Dahal on Thursday and discussed government formation. But as the new government will be a coalition one, the Congress needs the support of coalition partners to get Deuba appointed prime minister.
    
    Maoist chair Dahal, who claims to have been cheated out of the post by CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in the post-2017 government, is himself waiting in the wings to head the next government. Also, Dahal and Deuba reportedly have a gentleman’s agreement to lead the next government by turns; Maoist Centre insiders say Dahal wants to become prime minister for the first two and a half years.
    
    But Deuba is quietly making his own preparations to head the new government and is working to bring the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, besides the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, on board. On Thursday Deuba separately met Janamat Party chief CK Raut and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party chair Mahantha Thakur. Raut also met Dahal on Thursday evening and discussed the possibility of joining the government.
    
    Maoist Centre leaders, meanwhile, are hoping that the ruling alliance would readily accept Dahal as next prime minister, arguing that he played a crucial role in unseating the Oli-led government and rallying support behind Deuba last year.
    
    “A section of Nepali Congress leaders also fears that Dahal can switch sides and join the UML camp,” a senior Nepali Congress leader said, adding, “Before Dahal takes such a drastic step, we have to accept him as next prime minister and save the alliance.”
    
    UML Chairman Oli, meanwhile, has already invited Dahal to sit for talks to discuss a new leftist government under the latter’s leadership. Oli has reportedly proposed heading the new government alternately for two and a half years each.
    
    But Maoist leaders doubt the offer. According to a senior Maoist leader, UML is a divided house with competing interest groups, and Oli’s offer may not be genuine. “We are getting patchy and mixed signals from the UML, so as of now the possibility of our party partnering with the UML is low,” said the Maoist leader.
    
    The leader said Dahal has already told some Maoist leaders in private that he will look for an opportunity to lead the next government.
    
    But the road to premiership will be a bumpy one for Dahal. Some ruling alliance leaders like Minister for Urban Development of the CPN (Unified Socialist), Metmani Chaudhary, have already announced that Deuba will be the next prime minister. Chaudhary, speaking in Kathmandu on Thursday, even claimed that under a new power-sharing deal, his party is likely to appoint the new Speaker of the House of Representatives while the Maoist Centre’s nominee may be the President.
    
    He rejected the possibility of a left coalition government involving the UML and said the current ruling coalition will most likely settle on a power-sharing deal with member parties sharing top posts including the President, Vice-president, Prime Minister, Speaker, Deputy speaker and provincial chief ministers.
    
    “A UML-led coalition is not possible now. The existing coalition itself will form the new government. And as the biggest party in the coalition, the Congress has every right to lead the government. The Maoist Centre is the second-largest in the coalition, so it will settle for President,” Chaudhary said. “We may also claim the Speaker’s post. I think talks will move ahead accordingly.”
    
    Though vote-counting in the three remaining constituencies—Bajura, Syangja and Dolakha—is under way, the counting of all proportional representation votes is set to be completed and a picture of the parties’ respective strengths is already clear.
    
    The Nepali Congress will be the largest party with around 90 seats, followed by the UML with 80 seats, while the Maoist Centre is headed for third position with around 31 seats. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the new outfit led by journalist Rabi Lamichhane, with around 21 seats, will be the fourth biggest parliamentary party.
    
    While some think the chances of Maoist Centre chair Dahal heading the new government have diminished with the party’s ‘unexpectedly poor showing’ in the elections, others believe that Dahal is still a kingmaker and will make best use of his options to get to power.
    
    However, given the growing internal conflict within the Congress party with its general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma prepared to field Gagan Thapa, another general secretary, for prime minister, some observers say Dahal could take advantage of the infighting and become the prime minister for the first two-year term.
    
    Not only General Secretary Thapa, senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel and leader Shekhar Koirala are also eyeing the coveted post. Poudel too has already started lobbying with influential leaders across parties to back his own bid.
    
    “There is an intense conflict in the Congress to remove Deuba from the helm,” said Ramesh Malla, chief personal secretary to Maoist chair Dahal. “Although serious discussions on government leadership are yet to start, we cannot rule out the possibility of our chairman leading the new government with Congress’ support.”
    
    Meanwhile, Dahal on Wednesday went to Sukute in Sindhupalchok, apparently to seek a respite from Kathmandu’s hectic schedule. There he met his confidants including former speaker Agni Sapkota and expressed his readiness to lead the next government with the coalition’s support.
    
    “Our party’s first priority is to form a government from within the existing coalition and we believe our party chair should get to lead the government in the first go,” Maoist Centre’s Sindhupalchok district in-charge Madhav Sapkota, who won the parliamentary seat from Sindhupalchowk-1, told the Post. Dahal’s trip was arranged by Sapkota.
    
    As part of the coalition’s preparations to form new government, Dahal along with CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Nepal and Nepal Samajbadi Party chair Baburam Bhattarai recently met Resham Chaudhary, the jailed leader of the Nagarik Unmukti Party (which has won three FPTP seats in the lower house), at Dillibazar Sadarkhor prison.
    
    Meanwhile, two Unified Socialist leaders talking to the Post dismissed the possibility of the Congress supporting Dahal’s bid for prime minister. “The first priority of the Congress establishment faction is prime minister for Deuba and if not, it could propose Ram Chandra Poudel for the post. I don’t think they will back a communist to lead the government,” said a senior Unified Socialist leader asking not to be named.
    
    The leader also rejected the possibility of Dahal partnering with the UML to become prime minister. “I have also heard of Oli’s PM proposal for Dahal. But I don’t think they can muster a majority.”

    “A section of Nepali Congress leaders also fears that Dahal can switch sides and join the UML camp,” a senior Nepali Congress leader said, adding, “Before Dahal takes such a drastic step, we have to accept him as next prime minister and save the alliance.”
    
    UML Chairman Oli, meanwhile, has already invited Dahal to sit for talks to discuss a new leftist government under the latter’s leadership. Oli has reportedly proposed heading the new government alternately for two and a half years each.
    
    But Maoist leaders doubt the offer. According to a senior Maoist leader, UML is a divided house with competing interest groups, and Oli’s offer may not be genuine. “We are getting patchy and mixed signals from the UML, so as of now the possibility of our party partnering with the UML is low,” said the Maoist leader.
    
    The leader said Dahal has already told some Maoist leaders in private that he will look for an opportunity to lead the next government.
    
    But the road to premiership will be a bumpy one for Dahal. Some ruling alliance leaders like Minister for Urban Development of the CPN (Unified Socialist), Metmani Chaudhary, have already announced that Deuba will be the next prime minister. Chaudhary, speaking in Kathmandu on Thursday, even claimed that under a new power-sharing deal, his party is likely to appoint the new Speaker of the House of Representatives while the Maoist Centre’s nominee may be the President.
    
    He rejected the possibility of a left coalition government involving the UML and said the current ruling coalition will most likely settle on a power-sharing deal with member parties sharing top posts including the President, Vice-president, Prime Minister, Speaker, Deputy speaker and provincial chief ministers.
    
    “A UML-led coalition is not possible now. The existing coalition itself will form the new government. And as the biggest party in the coalition, the Congress has every right to lead the government. The Maoist Centre is the second-largest in the coalition, so it will settle for President,” Chaudhary said. “We may also claim the Speaker’s post. I think talks will move ahead accordingly.”
    
    Though vote-counting in the three remaining constituencies—Bajura, Syangja and Dolakha—is under way, the counting of all proportional representation votes is set to be completed and a picture of the parties’ respective strengths is already clear.
    
    The Nepali Congress will be the largest party with around 90 seats, followed by the UML with 80 seats, while the Maoist Centre is headed for third position with around 31 seats. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the new outfit led by journalist Rabi Lamichhane, with around 21 seats, will be the fourth biggest parliamentary party.
    
    While some think the chances of Maoist Centre chair Dahal heading the new government have diminished with the party’s ‘unexpectedly poor showing’ in the elections, others believe that Dahal is still a kingmaker and will make best use of his options to get to power.
    
    However, given the growing internal conflict within the Congress party with its general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma prepared to field Gagan Thapa, another general secretary, for prime minister, some observers say Dahal could take advantage of the infighting and become the prime minister for the first two-year term.
    
    Not only General Secretary Thapa, senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel and leader Shekhar Koirala are also eyeing the coveted post. Poudel too has already started lobbying with influential leaders across parties to back his own bid.
    
    “There is an intense conflict in the Congress to remove Deuba from the helm,” said Ramesh Malla, chief personal secretary to Maoist chair Dahal. “Although serious discussions on government leadership are yet to start, we cannot rule out the possibility of our chairman leading the new government with Congress’ support.”
    
    Meanwhile, Dahal on Wednesday went to Sukute in Sindhupalchok, apparently to seek a respite from Kathmandu’s hectic schedule. There he met his confidants including former speaker Agni Sapkota and expressed his readiness to lead the next government with the coalition’s support.
    
    “Our party’s first priority is to form a government from within the existing coalition and we believe our party chair should get to lead the government in the first go,” Maoist Centre’s Sindhupalchok district in-charge Madhav Sapkota, who won the parliamentary seat from Sindhupalchowk-1, told the Post. Dahal’s trip was arranged by Sapkota.
    
    As part of the coalition’s preparations to form new government, Dahal along with CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Nepal and Nepal Samajbadi Party chair Baburam Bhattarai recently met Resham Chaudhary, the jailed leader of the Nagarik Unmukti Party (which has won three FPTP seats in the lower house), at Dillibazar Sadarkhor prison.
    
    Meanwhile, two Unified Socialist leaders talking to the Post dismissed the possibility of the Congress supporting Dahal’s bid for prime minister. “The first priority of the Congress establishment faction is prime minister for Deuba and if not, it could propose Ram Chandra Poudel for the post. I don’t think they will back a communist to lead the government,” said a senior Unified Socialist leader asking not to be named.
    
    The leader also rejected the possibility of Dahal partnering with the UML to become prime minister. “I have also heard of Oli’s PM proposal for Dahal. But I don’t think they can muster a majority.”

      "Retired Gurkha veterans, British government officials hold third round talks",
    description: `With the counting of both the first-past-the-post (FPTP) and proportional representation (PR) votes of the November 20 elections nearly over, leaders have intensified meetings and behind-the-curtain negotiations to form a new government and, above all, to decide the new prime minister.

    There are several claimants for the post. Incumbent Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, and Congress leader Ram Chandra Paudel, among others, have already staked their claims to the top executive job.
    
    And with no party getting a majority, there is no clarity on the shape of the new government as well as on its leadership.
    
    A section of the Congress establishment camp has already proposed Deuba for prime minister. “We should not seek an alternative to Deuba,” Congress Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka said on Thursday.
    
    “We went to the election under his leadership and got respectable results. So no one should doubt that Deuba is the undisputed candidate for parliamentary party leader,” he added. As per the charter of the Nepali Congress, any lawmaker aspiring to become prime minister should first be elected parliamentary party leader.
    
    Khadka, a lieutenant of Deuba, met Dahal on Thursday and discussed government formation. But as the new government will be a coalition one, the Congress needs the support of coalition partners to get Deuba appointed prime minister.
    
    Maoist chair Dahal, who claims to have been cheated out of the post by CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in the post-2017 government, is himself waiting in the wings to head the next government. Also, Dahal and Deuba reportedly have a gentleman’s agreement to lead the next government by turns; Maoist Centre insiders say Dahal wants to become prime minister for the first two and a half years.
    
    But Deuba is quietly making his own preparations to head the new government and is working to bring the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, besides the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, on board. On Thursday Deuba separately met Janamat Party chief CK Raut and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party chair Mahantha Thakur. Raut also met Dahal on Thursday evening and discussed the possibility of joining the government.
    
    Maoist Centre leaders, meanwhile, are hoping that the ruling alliance would readily accept Dahal as next prime minister, arguing that he played a crucial role in unseating the Oli-led government and rallying support behind Deuba last year.
    
    “A section of Nepali Congress leaders also fears that Dahal can switch sides and join the UML camp,” a senior Nepali Congress leader said, adding, “Before Dahal takes such a drastic step, we have to accept him as next prime minister and save the alliance.”
