        Identifying Money By Maureen A. Duffy, M.S., CVRT The rise in popularity
        of debit cards means that more and more retailers—even small ones like
        your corner newsstand or dry cleaner—no longer require cash for
        purchases. For customers with vision loss, this reduces some of the
        planning and identification issues that can arise when handling bills
        and coins. If you decide to use your debit card, you may want to mark it
        so that it’s easy to identify in your wallet. See Labeling and Marking
        for more information on helpful labeling materials and devices and
        Banking Services and Credit Cards for hints on using your debit and
        credit cards independently. If you’re more comfortable using cash for
        your purchases, there are several different ways to identify your United
        States bills and coins independently: Coins can be easily identified by
        touch. Each coin is a different size and the edges are either smooth or
        ridged. Nickels and pennies have smooth edges; the nickel is thicker and
        larger than the penny. Dimes and quarters both have ridged edges, and
        the quarter is thicker and larger than the dime.
